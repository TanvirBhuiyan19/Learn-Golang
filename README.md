# Learn-Golang

This repository is a collection of practice programs and experiments designed to explore and understand the fundamentals of GoLang. It includes various small projects and exercises that demonstrate key concepts and practical applications of the Go programming language.

## Features

### 1. Basics
- **[pointer.go](pointer.go)**: Demonstrates the use of pointers, including referencing, dereferencing, and updating values.
- **[functions.go](functions.go)**: Implements a simple function to calculate the sum of two numbers.
- **[flow_control.go](flow_control.go)**: Explores flow control structures such as `if-else`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `range`, and `while`).

### 2. File Management
- **[file_management/main.go](file_management/main.go)**: Demonstrates file and directory operations, including creating files, writing content, and managing paths.

### 3. Web Development
- **[net_http_package/main.go](net_http_package/main.go)**: A basic HTTP server with routes for home, about, and terms pages.
- **[http_server/main.go](http_server/main.go)**: A simple TCP-based HTTP server that serves a static HTML response.

### 4. Web Application (Loruki)
- **[loruki/main.go](loruki/main.go)**: A web application with templating and database integration for a cloud hosting platform demo.
  - **Templates**: Includes reusable HTML templates for pages like features and documentation.
  - **Assets**: Contains CSS files for styling the application.

### 5. Database Integration
- **[loruki/main.go](loruki/main.go)**: Demonstrates connecting to a MySQL database and performing basic CRUD operations.

### 6. Geolocation API
- **[geolocation/main.go](geolocation/main.go)**: Fetches geolocation data for a given IP address or domain using a public API.

### 7. Excel File Manipulation
- **[Excel/main.go](Excel/main.go)**: Uses the `excelize` library to create and manipulate Excel files.

### 8. User Input
- **[main.go](main.go)**: Reads user input (name and age) and displays it.
