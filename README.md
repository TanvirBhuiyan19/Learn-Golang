# Learn-Golang

This repository contains a collection of practice programs and experiments to learn and explore GoLang concepts. It includes various small projects and exercises to understand the fundamentals of Go programming.

## Contents

### 1. Basics
- **[pointer.go](pointer.go)**: Demonstrates the use of pointers in Go, including referencing, dereferencing, and updating values via pointers.
- **[functions.go](functions.go)**: Implements a simple function to calculate the sum of two numbers.
- **[flow_control.go](flow_control.go)**: Explores flow control structures like `if-else`, `switch`, and loops (`for`, `range`, and `while`).

### 2. File Management
- **[file_management/main.go](file_management/main.go)**: Demonstrates file and directory operations, including creating files, writing content, and managing paths.

### 3. Web Development
- **[net_http_package/main.go](net_http_package/main.go)**: A basic HTTP server with routes for home, about, and terms pages.
- **[http_server/main.go](http_server/main.go)**: A simple TCP-based HTTP server that serves a static HTML response.

### 4. Web Application (Loruki)
- **[loruki/main.go](loruki/main.go)**: A web application with templating and database integration for a cloud hosting platform demo.
- **Templates**: Includes reusable HTML templates for pages like features and documentation.
- **Assets**: Contains CSS files for styling the application.

### 5. Database Integration
- **[loruki/main.go](loruki/main.go)**: Demonstrates connecting to a MySQL database and performing basic CRUD operations.

### 6. Geolocation API
- **[geolocation/main.go](geolocation/main.go)**: Fetches geolocation data for a given IP address or domain using a public API.

### 7. Excel File Manipulation
- **[Excel/main.go](Excel/main.go)**: Uses the `excelize` library to create and manipulate Excel files.

### 8. User Input
- **[main.go](main.go)**: Reads user input (name and age) and displays it.
